You have access to my CalDAV calendar.

To fetch events:
- Use natural language like "show my calendar events today" or "what's on my schedule next week".
- Authenticate via iCloud if needed (assume credentials in env or config).

Tools available internally: caldav fetch, list calendars, add event.
